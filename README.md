# QCPP

### Introduction
QCPP is a c++ library which can simulate an actual **Quantum Computer** by using conventional one.  
This code can be used to implement quantum algorithm such as shor's algorithm, grover's algorithm.  
some examples are provided at [examples/](http://github.com/phirasit/QCPP/examples)

**NOTE**: the code (QCPP.h) is written in C++11.

for more information look at [docs/](http://github.com/phirasit/QCPP/docs)
